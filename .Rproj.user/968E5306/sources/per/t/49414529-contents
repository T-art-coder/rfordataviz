This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

The other column is the average life expectancy in a given year for OECD countries, excluding the United States. The usa column is the US life expectancy, diff is the difference between the two values, and hi_lo indicates whether the US value for that year was above or below the OECD average. We will plot the difference over time, and use the hi_lo variable to color the columns in the chart.
```{r}
head(oecd_sum)
```


```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = oecd_sum,
            mapping = aes(x = year, y = diff, fill = hi_lo))
p + geom_col() + guides(fill = FALSE) +
